            <p class="info"> Idaho is known for its beautiful mountains and rivers, and the Portneuf River is no exception. Although it's much less visited than other rivers near by, it provides a variety of experiences ranging from our Kiddie Rapids to our most advanced rafting trail. Our main headquarters is located on the edge of the family ranch in Lava Hot Springs, Idaho. The farm was originally homesteaded by Aunt Mo's grandfather, and has remained in the family ever since. </p>

            <h1 class="titles">Who was Aunt Mo? </h1>
            <p class="info">In 1912, Molly Richardson was born to two loving parents, Kendall and Maria Richardson. Part of a family of twelve kids, Molly learned to work hard on the ranch, helping to raise cows, chickens
                goats, geese, and the ethics that continue to propel our business. She was a firm believer in honesty, loyalty, and making a penny stretch. She learned what poverty felt like when the ranch fell on hard times, and as a sixteen year old girl, suggested that they turn the family's favorite past-time, floating the river that irrigated their fields, into a business. 
                As they weathered the Great Depression by adding to their meager farm income with the few tourists that would visit the farm's river. As the economy slowly recovered, more and more visitors came to the ranch to test out the rapids. As they came, they also were able to meet
                Molly and her family. As Molly grew up, she married Paul Edison, and they took over the ranch when her parents retired. Although Molly and Paul were unable to have children, her siblings' children became almost like her own. Aunt Mo was a vital part of their lives, and even after her passing in 2007, her nieces and nephews would visit the ranch and continue maintaining the rafting business, Aunt Mo's Whitewater Adventures.
