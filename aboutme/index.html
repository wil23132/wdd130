    <h2> KATE MARLENE WILLIAMS </h2>
    <h2> otherwise known as kater </h2>
    <p> I live in a tiny town in Southeastern Idaho. I'm a concurrent enrollment student, but I will be graduating this
        spring and then attending college full time! I'm hoping to major in piano performance.
    <p>I am the oldest of six kids, so I do a lot with my siblings. One of my favorite scriptures is 2nd Nephi 8:12-13
        because it talks about how God created and cares so much about us. </p>
    </p>
    <p> I absolutely love anything with music, and I'm involved in choir, orchestra, teaching piano, and more. </p>
    <p> I love doing family history as well and then going to the temple to do baptisms and confirmations for the dead.
    </p>
    <p> I also love volleyball, drama, track, and snowboarding.
