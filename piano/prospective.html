        <h1>About Kate Williams</h1>
        <p>Kate grew up in a tiny town in Southeastern Idaho. Even though there were only three hundred people in her town, there was an incredible and inspiring piano teacher only fifteen minutes away. As she began taking lessons, Kate learned that she had a passion for this instrument and the things she could do with it. She received many different opportunities to perform and accompany singers or other ensembles. After her first teacher retired, Kate began taking lessons from Mark Neiwirth, a concert pianist and adjunct professor of piano at Idaho State University. Through many hours of consistent and dedicated practice, she has continued to hone her skills.</p>

        <h1>Accomplishments</h1>
        <p>During her junior year, Kate participated in a scholarship program, called Distinguished Young Women. She received awards for her piano performance at both a local and state level. She also was a finalist at the Musicians West piano competition. Her teaching style includes patience with students, an encouragement to develop self-led practice techniques, learning how to analyze, memorize, and perform music effectively, and use music theory as a tool to make learning more efficient. Kateâ€™s plans after high school include joining the piano performance program at Brigham Young University- Idaho, and gaining more knowledge to utilize in her own performances, as well as share with her current and future students.
