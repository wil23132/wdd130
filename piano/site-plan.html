        KATE WILLIAMS PIANO EDUCATION 

Get Started 

Piano is the most versatile instrument. Everything from jazz and acoustic, to rock and roll and rap has been arranged for the piano. It’s been one of the most popular and widely played instruments since its creation in the early 1700s. It also is one of the most effective hobbies to increase brain activity, attention to detail, and increased concentration and memory. 
You can learn how to become a skilled performer on this incredible instrument! It takes practice and dedication, and because of its complexity, a good, knowledgeable, and patient teacher can shape and speed up your learning exponentially. 
(quote with picture) “I may be young, but I believe this is one way I’m able to connect with children and teenagers that want to learn the piano. I know what it’s like to be busy with school and other activities, and the discipline it takes to practice.” 

One such teacher is Kate Williams. Though she’s only eighteen years old, she has six years of teaching experience and has received several performance opportunities. As the student of two remarkable teachers, Angie Lloyd and Mark Neiwirth, she has learned many skills and techniques that she readily passes on to her students. Through her personal connection and one-on-one lessons, she is able to understand each student’s needs, and give them the exercises and repertoire that will help them succeed. 
“There’s no feeling like guiding students to learn music. It takes my love of piano, and combines it with the opportunity to directly help and mentor others.” (quote with picture as part of the home page.)

        About Kate Williams
        Kate grew up in a tiny town in Southeastern Idaho. Even though there were only three hundred people in her town, there was an incredible and inspiring piano teacher only fifteen minutes away. As she began taking lessons, Kate learned that she had a passion for this instrument and the things she could do with it. She received many different opportunities to perform and accompany singers or other ensembles. After her first teacher retired, Kate began taking lessons from Mark Neiwirth, a concert pianist and adjunct professor of piano at Idaho State University. Through many hours of consistent and dedicated practice, she has continued to hone her skills. 
During her junior year, Kate participated in a scholarship program, called Distinguished Young Women. She received awards for her piano performance at both a local and state level. She also was a finalist at the Musicians West piano competition. 
Her teaching style includes patience with students, an encouragement to develop self-led practice techniques, learning how to analyze, memorize, and perform music effectively, and use music theory as a tool to make learning more efficient. Kate’s plans after high school include joining the piano performance program at Brigham Young University- Idaho, and gaining more knowledge to utilize in her own performances, as well as share with her current and future students.
